- RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
- The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables.
- A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.
- SELECT -> SELECT column_name,column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name operator value ORDER BY column_name ASC|DESC;
- Operators: (=) Equal, (<>/!=) Not equal, (>) Greater than, (<) Less than, (>=) Greater than or equal, (<=) Less than or equal, (BETWEEN) Between an inclusive range, (LIKE) Search for a pattern, (IN) To specify multiple possible values for a column
- ORDER BY -> Ascending by default
- INSERT -> INSERT INTO table_name (column1,column2,column3,...) VALUES (value1,value2,value3,...);
- UPDATE -> UPDATE table_name SET column1=value1,column2=value2 WHERE some_column=some_value;
- DELETE -> DELETE FROM table_name WHERE some_column=some_value; 
- TOP -> Used to specify the number of records to return. 
  - MYSQL uses LIMIT -> SELECT * FROM Persons LIMIT 5;
  - ORACLE use ROWNUM -> SELECT * FROM Persons WHERE ROWNUM <=5;
- Whildcards ->
  - % 	A substitute for zero or more characters
  - _ 	A substitute for a single character
  - SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City LIKE '[bsp]%'; -> Select all customers who live in a city starting from b, s OR p
  - SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City LIKE '[a-c]%'; -> All customers who live in a city starting from a, b OR c
- JOINS -> Best explanation -> https://blog.codinghorror.com/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins/
  - INNER JOIN -> Inner join produces only the set of records that match in both Table A and Table B. 
  - FULL OUTER JOIN -> Full outer join produces the set of all records in Table A and Table B, with matching records from both sides where available. If there is no match, the missing side will contain null.
  - LEFT OUTER JOIN -> Left outer join produces a complete set of records from Table A, with the matching records (where available) in Table B. If there is no match, the right side will contain null. 
  - RIGHT OUTER JOIN -> Right outer join produces complete set of records from Table B, with matching records from Table A. If there is no match, the left side will contain null.
  - CROSS JOIN -> Join everything with everything.
